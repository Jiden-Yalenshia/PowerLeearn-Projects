File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è: Create a program that reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file.
Error Handling Lab üß™: Ask the user for a filename and handle errors if it doesn‚Äôt exist or can‚Äôt be read.

# Ask the user for the file name
n = input("Enter the name of the file to read: ")

try:
    # Try opening the input file in read mode
    with open(n, "r") as y:
        # Read the file contents
        content = y.read()

        # Modify the content (example: make it uppercase)
        modified_content = content.upper()

        # Create a new output file to store the modified content
        with open("modified_" + n, "w") as outfile:
            outfile.write(modified_content)

        print(f"‚úÖ File has been read and modified successfully!")
        print(f"‚û°Ô∏è Modified file saved as: modified_{filename}")

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("‚ùå Error: The file does not exist. Please check the filename and try again.")
except PermissionError:
    print("‚ùå Error: You don't have permission to read this file.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
